Laptop
======

I've forked this script from <https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop>. It is a script to set up an macOS laptop for web and mobile development. Subsequent changes have been integrated from <https://github.com/monfresh/laptop> as well.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Note: I have modified this version to suit my own requirements, which tend towards a hybrid of coding for data science (in R and Python), web publishing and academic writing.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* macOS Mavericks (10.9)
* macOS Yosemite (10.10)
* macOS El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)
* macOS Mojave (10.14)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kidwellj/laptop/master/mac
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```

I also use a [dotfiles script][jkdotfiles] which is a fork of [thoughtbot/dotfiles][dotfiles].

[dotfiles]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles#install
[jkdotfiles]: https://github.com/kidwellj/dotfiles#install

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
}

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
fi

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
}

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
fi

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.
